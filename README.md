# Quizz-Cheat
A Script that allows you to find any answers on quizz. The script is made using javascipt which is why,
it can be used on tampermonkey or on the console of your browser.

# How to Install
To install the scipt, you need to download the [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) which is avaliable on many browsers as an extension. Once you have downloaded and loaed up the extension, then you should be able to install the script. Click on the tampermonkey logo and a drop-down menu should open where you should see the option "Create a new script", click on it and a page should open up. On the page you will see some lines of code already writen, delete it and paste the script in the page. Once you have pasted the scipt, just save it either by clicking on "File" option and save it or just ctrl + S. Once your done, you can now go to [quizzz](https://quizizz.com/) and the answers should be highlighted
